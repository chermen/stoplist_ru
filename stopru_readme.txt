This stop list of common Russian words was develope based on the stop list available here http://svn.tartarus.org/snowball/trunk/website/algorithms/russian/stop.txt?revision=275&view=markup with added words, based on my text analysis of international treaties between Russia, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. 

I removed words that were specific to my research from this list, such as "Russia", "Abkhasia", etc. Also, I extended the existing words by adding all of their forms in present tense whenever applicable.

All words are arranged in alphabetical order.
